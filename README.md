# 3D Image Plotting with Matplotlib (Python)

This project demonstrates how to create 3D plots of image data using Python and Matplotlib. It visualizes the intensity values of a grayscale image as a 3D surface.

## ðŸ“ˆ Features

- Converts 2D image data into a 3D surface
- Uses Matplotlib's `plot_surface` for visualization
- Demonstrates image reading, grayscale conversion, and 3D mesh plotting

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (cv2) or PIL (for image handling)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Install dependencies: `pip install numpy matplotlib opencv-python`
2. Open `3D_image_plotting.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run each cell step by step.
4. Replace the default image with your own if desired.
